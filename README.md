# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz Java Program

This is a simple Java program that implements the FizzBuzz problem. FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem often used 
as an exercise in the early stages of learning to code. The program prints numbers from 1 to a specified limit, 
but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, 
and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".
